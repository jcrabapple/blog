Update: I've updated the post with some notes and additional suggestions from folks on Mastodon! Thanks, everyone!

I made a post on Mastodon asking for input on non-self-hosted, user friendly solutions for alternatives to big tech products. The answers were mostly very technical and mostly self-hosted. I'm talking about services your parents or grandparents could use. Primarily cloud services that are easily accessible on both desktop via a web browser or app, and via a mobile app.

It seemed like a good subject for a blog post, so here we are. These are some options that are, in my opinion, good big tech alternatives for the average, non-technical person.
