TIL that pretzels were invented by Catholic monks in the Middle Ages.

Back then, pretzels were thought to be shaped like arms crossed in prayer. They were not just a tasty treat, but also served a religious purpose. People would often eat pretzels during religious holidays and especially during Lent. This is because they are made without dairy products, making them a perfect food for fasting.
