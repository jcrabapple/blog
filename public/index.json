I think this is a big change from traditional search, and with the way things are going and more people using AI search, either people need to learn how to use them correctly or the search companies need to make the search better. Or both.\nNormally, you would Google something like \u0026ldquo;7-day healthy meal plan\u0026rdquo;. You\u0026rsquo;d get a list of links to various websites that offered generic 7-day meal plans, you\u0026rsquo;ll get some health food websites with recipes, and you\u0026rsquo;d likely get some nutritionist websites that will possibly help you tailor a diet to you specifically and consider allergies or whatever. You can dive in here and do your research. This takes more time and effort but can be very much worth it in the end.\nWith an LLM you don\u0026rsquo;t get all this. Generally, it spits out what you ask for and nothing else. You ask it for a healthy 7-day meal plan and it\u0026rsquo;ll spit out a generic \u0026ldquo;healthy\u0026rdquo; meal plan for 7 days based on the top couple of results from a web search. It\u0026rsquo;s not going to personalize it or provide nutritional information or consider allergies by default. You have to ask it for this additional information and how you would like it to be presented. Sure, it looks cool when you ask it for something and it spits out this formatted wall of text, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is ready for prime time. It\u0026rsquo;s another public alpha product from big tech.\n","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-05-20-ai_llm_search/","section":"Posts","summary":"My friend and I were discussing AI/LLM search, and while I think some LLM search can be useful, you have to make it work for you.","title":"More Thoughts on AI and LLMs in Search","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/search/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"search","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"web","type":"tags"},{"content":"Reading up on the announcements from Google I/O got me thinking more about how LLMs source their content and how they present it.\nA traditional Google search would have given you a list of links, ranked by how relevant they were to your search query. Though in recent years they seem to be ranked by how much the website owner is paying Google, or by how well they were able to game Google\u0026rsquo;s algorithm with SEO. You would browse through these links, click on the ones that interested you, and read their content. You\u0026rsquo;d likely be presented with ads that generated revenue for the content owner, which incentivized them to create more good content that people would click on in the first page of search results. This process made money for both Google and the content creators.\nThis system started breaking down long before LLMs were involved. Google dropped the ball with search years ago, and results became flooded with SEO spam and AI-generated clickbait. Now, with things like Google Gemini, a search returns a summarized answer that the LLM \u0026ldquo;thinks\u0026rdquo; is correct based on the content scraped from the most relevant links in the search results. However, most of the time no sources are cited and no links provided to websites where this information came from. You can no longer click through to a website to read the article and look at ads to generate revenue for the content owner.\nHere is the crux of the problem. As Google Gemini and other LLMs replace traditional search (which is exactly what Google seems to want), traffic to websites will plummet. Ad revenue will sink with it.\nAt this point\u0026hellip;\nWhat incentivizes content creators to create content if no one is looking at it and no ad revenue is coming in? If content creators stop creating content, where does Google train the LLM? How does Google make money? Will they display ads in the LLM answers? This seems self-defeating. If Google has no content with which to train the LLM, do they hire contractors to create content for Gemini? Some content is unchanging but most information needs to be updated over time. My final question is: Where does the web go from here? I like a quick answer as much as anyone, but when I want to verify something or learn more than can be said in a few sentences, I want more sources and diverse information. What impact will this have on our society? I think there\u0026rsquo;s already too much power in the hands of big tech when it comes to control of information. Proxying snippets of information through an LLM seems like another outlet for controlling and manipulating what people see and think. Is the answer a compromise like what Perplexity AI is doing? They provide an LLM summarized answer with links to roughly half a dozen sources for further reading.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious to hear others\u0026rsquo; thoughts and ideas on this subject.

Update on the Bell\u0026rsquo;s Palsy facial paralysis: It\u0026rsquo;s mostly back to normal! I have mostly regained control of my right side. My face has gone from really goofy looking to just normal goofy looking. The only symptom really left is ear sensitivity to high pitched sounds, so when the dogs bark in the house or when someone clanks dishes together, it physically hurts me, but hopefully that resolves itself given a bit more time.\nI bought a car last week for my daughters. They turned 16 in September of 2023, and they\u0026rsquo;ve been practicing driving off and on since last summer. I got them a red 2017 Hyundai Elantra in great condition. It should be a safe and reliable car for them to use for a few years. They\u0026rsquo;re very excited about it. We took them to Target and Wal-mart and let them pick out some accessories for it, and we got them a safety and emergency kit. They spent about an hour on Tuesday cleaning every nook and cranny to their standards despite the fact that the dealership had just detailed it. They should both be ready to get their licenses in the next month or so.\nMother\u0026rsquo;s Day is coming up this weekend in the US. I sent my mom a card and an Edible Arrangement (she loves cheesy stuff like that). One of the things the kids and I are doing for my wife is we are going to recreate a photo of our four girls that was taken on the first trip we took together as a family, to Historic Williamsburg and Busch Gardens. It was taken in front of a huge, old tree in Williamsburg. We found a tree here in town that is very similar, so tonight I\u0026rsquo;m getting them all together to go and take the photo. My wife is going to love it. Sunday we are going to the Hope Flower Farm and Winery with her daughter (my daughters will be with their mom) to pick some flowers and check out the live music and food trucks.\n","date":"9 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2024-05-09-face-status-and-more/","section":"Posts","summary":"I really got you with that title, huh?","title":"Face Status and More","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/family/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Family","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/health/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Health","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Life","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"9 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/parenting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Parenting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"29 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/events/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Events","type":"tags"},{"content":"My wife and I spend a lot of time together.
