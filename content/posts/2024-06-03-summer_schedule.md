If you don't know, my wife and I have a blended family. We're both on our second marriage, and we have 4 girls between us. The oldest is a few years into college, so she stops by occasionally but she's usually doing her own thing. During the school year the kids are here every Tuesday and Thursday, and every other weekend. My kids live with their mom primarily, 30 minutes away from, so there's a lot of back and forth during school.

However, during the summer we reduce this back and forth, and make it easier to go on vacations, by switching to a week on, week off schedule. This week is the first week off. It's nice to have them here for an entire week, but it's hard to go a week without them. We know it's the best situation for everyone though.

We have some small vacation plans coming up at the end of this month, and a few days at the eastern shore in July. There will be lots of hiking, some tubing and kayaking, and a bit of backyard badminton this summer as well. It takes a bit of adjustment when summer first starts, but I'm excited for it.
