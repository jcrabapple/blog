I must be doing something right.
{{< /lead >}}

Parenting is hard. Relationships are hard. Sometimes it feels like I'm too flawed to be good at either of them. Sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try and no matter how good my intentions, things don't go the way I had hoped.

I guess I'm doing OK though. After our Father's Day zip-lining adventure, we went over to the brewey next door for some lunch and drinks. As we were talking, one of my teenage daughters (16) was talking about a girl at school that she just started dating. My oldest stepdaughter (21) said something to the effect of "I'm so glad you like girls. Honestly, I hope you both like girls because men are trash." She then went on for a few minutes about her bad experience with men in general and finished with "There are no good men out there, except dad. I wish all men were like dad."

It makes me feel really good to know that I've been a good male role model for my daughters. Sometimes it's hard to be a dad raising daughters, especially when they're teenagers. They don't often want to talk so it's hard to get feedback. I'm really happy my daughter said what she said. I couldn't have asked for a better compliment on Father's Day.
