The mid 90s were a great time for music.


I was just entering my teenage years and beginning to listen to a lot of music suggested to me by friends, rather than just what I was hearing on the radio or seeing on MTV and VH1. These are some of the albums from 1994 that stand out to me as having stuck with me in a more significant way over the last 30 years.
