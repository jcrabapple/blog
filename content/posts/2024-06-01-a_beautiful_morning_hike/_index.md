This morning we managed to get 2/3 of the children up and out the door at 9am for a hike. One of the teenagers decided she would rather sleep in.

The trail is a nice, mostly paved loop at the Shenandoah University agricultural center at Cool Springs Battlefield. You can continue on to a wooded trail at about halfway through the loop, which takes you to a small waterfall in the creek. We used to be able to go up above the waterfall, but they now have this blocked off.
