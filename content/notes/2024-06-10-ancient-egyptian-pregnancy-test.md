TIL that ancient Egyptians used a surprisingly effective pregnancy test involving barley and wheat seeds.

Around 1350 BCE, women would urinate on bags of these grains, and if they sprouted, it indicated pregnancy. A 1963 study confirmed the test's accuracy at about 70%. The test likely worked due to elevated estrogen levels in pregnant women's urine, which promoted seed growth.
